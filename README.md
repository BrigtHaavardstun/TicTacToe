# NOTE

# IDEAS FOR PRESENTING
* 1:
    *  Make the students download python, and lett them play with basic tkinter for a while. 
    *  Show them this game, and explain and give them a overview of how its done using tkiner. (IMPORTANT: DON'T EXPLAIN DETAILS) 
*  2:
    * Show them the start of creating a TicTacToe game, and let them try to code a long.
    * After getting the basics to work you skip forward to the end, to show how the game could end up looking.
* 3:
    * Try to show them how to code the game from "start" to "finish", but have a lot of function already in place.
    * This could be possibal considering time usasge, but it might be confusing for the students not knowing what each part of the code is doing.
